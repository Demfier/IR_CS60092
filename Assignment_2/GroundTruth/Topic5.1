This isn't the way medical science is supposed to work.
A remedy used to treat creaky bones in horses and dogs works so well that humans start taking it.
It gets hyped in a best-selling book on arthritis and the number of users skyrockets.
Doctors get glowing testimonials from patients, so they tell other patients to try it.
Finally, with about 5 million Americans taking the concoction of crab shells and cow cartilage, enough begin asking how it works _ and enough doctors wonder whether it really does _ that scientists finally begin studying its safety and effectiveness.
That's what happened with glucosamine and chondroitin, which taken together or separately are now America's top-selling joint supplements.
The early results of research, including one study just published and another due out soon, suggest the treatment actually does ease joint pain and may even forestall further cartilage damage.
The promising research is bound to make the hard-to-pronounce potions, which are available over the counter, even more wildly popular.
``This is a strange, inverted application of the traditional scientific model,'' said Dr. Timothy McAlindon, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University who has analyzed the evidence on glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, here and abroad.
``The science isn't black or white.
We're building a case trying to figure out if this works or not, and at the moment the evidence is favoring these products''.

PEACH SPRINGS, Ariz.
(AP) - When American Indians began embracing gambling as an economic development tool in the 1990s, the Hualapai tribe in northern Arizona moved quickly to open a casino at its Grand Canyon West tourist site.
Tribal leaders figured that slot machines would provide new revenue for the tribe's 1,200 members, many of whom have lived in poverty for years.
But they forgot that most of the 100,000 visitors to Grand Canyon West each year come directly from Las Vegas.
''Those people weren't coming to a casino,'' said Louise Benson, tribal chairman.
''They were coming to see the Grand Canyon''.
Less than a year after opening the casino, the Hualapai shut it down.
Instead of providing an economic boom to tribal members, it left them $1 million in debt.
''There were high hopes for that casino, but the reality of it was that we were too isolated,'' said Alex Cabillo, the tribe's director of public works.
The Hualapai tribe is one of only two whose casinos failed during the Indian gambling boom of the past decade, when revenues exploded from $100 million in 1988 to $8.26 billion in 1998.
But an Associated Press computer analysis of federal unemployment, poverty and public assistance records indicates that the vast majority of American Indians, like the Hualapai, have not realized the early ''high hopes'' of the casino boom.
Two-thirds of the American Indian population belong to poverty-stricken tribes that still don't have Las Vegas-style casinos.
